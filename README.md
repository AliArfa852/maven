## Quick Start

> `dev` is the default branch and gets the newest changes first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AliArfa852/maven.git
cd maven
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open `http://localhost:7000` when the containers are healthy. The first admin password is printed in `docker compose logs odysseus`.

The compose files pull the official multi-arch image `ghcr.io/odysseus-dev/odysseus` (published by CI on every push to `main` and `dev`) and only build locally if the pull fails — so this also works on hosts without a build toolchain, e.g. as a [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) stack.

**Production deployments:** pin the immutable tag instead of `:latest`. `:latest` and bare `:X.Y.Z` tags move on every push to `main`, but `:X.Y.Z-<sha>` (e.g. `1.0.2-7c8070f`) always refers to one specific build:

```bash
ODYSSEUS_IMAGE=ghcr.io/odysseus-dev/odysseus:1.0.2-7c8070f docker compose up -d
```

Compose variables such as `ODYSSEUS_IMAGE` keep their names for now; app settings accept `MAVEN_AI_*`.

Native installs, GPU notes, Windows/macOS instructions, HTTPS, and configuration live in the [setup guide](website/setup.md).

## Based on Odysseus

Maven is a modified version of [Odysseus](https://github.com/odysseus-dev/odysseus), a self-hosted AI workspace by the Odysseus contributors. See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for details on the modifications and [ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md](ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md) for licensing information.

## Contributing

Help is welcome. The best entry points are fresh-install testing, provider setup bugs, mobile/editor polish, docs, and small focused refactors. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Security

Maven is a self-hosted workspace with powerful local tools. Keep auth enabled, keep private data out of Git, and do not expose raw model/service ports publicly.

- Keep `AUTH_ENABLED=true` for any network-accessible deployment.
- Keep `LOCALHOST_BYPASS=false` outside local development.

Deployment details are in the [setup guide](website/setup.md#security-notes).

## License

AGPL-3.0-or-later -- see [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md](ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md).
